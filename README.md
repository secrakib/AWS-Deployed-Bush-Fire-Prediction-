# Problem Statement  
Algeria has frequent wildfires, especially in the north during summer. These fires are caused by both natural factors (heat, drought) and human activities (agriculture, accidents). The fires damage the environment and are difficult to fight due to limited resources and terrain. The situation is expected to worsen due to climate change.

# Solution Approach

Highly Accurate Prediction Based On Easily Available Data Such As Temparature,Relative Humadity,Wind Speed etc.. Can Help Mitigate The Spread Of Bush Fire.

# Best Model 

We Proposed a Highly Accurate Predictive Model Based On **TEN** Easily Available Data Based On The Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System to Address This Problem.   
**Elasticnet CV -- R2 Of *97.1%***
